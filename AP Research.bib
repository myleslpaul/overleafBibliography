  abstract = {Although additive manufacturing (AM) enables designers to develop products with a high degree of design freedom, the manufacturing constraints of AM restrict design freedom. One of the key manufacturing constraints is the use of support structures for overhang features, which are indispensable in AM processes, but increase material consumption, manufacturing costs, and build time. Therefore, controlling support structure generation is a significant issue in fabricating functional products directly using AM. The goal of this paper is to propose a knowledge-based design algorithm for reducing support structures whilst considering printability and as-printed quality. The proposed method consists of three steps: (1) AM ontology development, for characterizing a target AM process, (2) Surrogate model construction, for quantifying the impact of the AM parameters on as-printed quality, (3) Design and process modification, for reducing support structures and optimizing the AM parameters. The significance of the proposed method is to not only optimize process parameters, but to also control local geometric features for a better surface roughness and build time reduction. To validate the proposed algorithm, case studies with curve-based (1D), surface-based (2D), and volume (3D) models were carried out to prove the reduction of support generation and build time while maintaining surface quality.},

However, these support structures are undesirable because they are removed during postprocessing after the part is built. It is critical to remove metal support structures because they can occasionally leave residue on the part. Among the various support-removal techniques, manual removal and wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) are the most frequently used. While most manufacturers recommend the manual method due to its economic benefits, it may be challenging for thin walls, small-scale components, and brittle materials. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare these two methods, taking into account both their advantages and disadvantages. The results indicate that while manual support-removal is quick, it results in a degraded surface topography and increased surface roughness due to support tooth remnants and residue. The wire EDM method of removing support resulted in a more uniform surface topography and a superior surface finish. However, as a result of thermal damage, a heat-affected zone developed on the machined surface.},

Notwithstanding the great variety of applications for FDM-printed objects, the choice of materials suitable for processing using AM technology is still limited, likely due to the lack of rapid screening procedures allowing for an efficient selection of processable polymer-based formulations. In this work, the rheological behavior of several 3D-printable, commercially available poly(lactic acid)-based filaments was accurately characterized. In particular, each step of a typical FDM process was addressed, from the melt flowability through the printing nozzle, to the interlayer adhesion in the post-deposition stage, evaluating the ability of the considered materials to fulfill the criteria for successful 3D printing using FDM technology. Furthermore, the rheological features of the investigated materials were related to their composition and microstructure. Although an exhaustive and accurate evaluation of the 3D printability of thermoplastics must also consider their thermal behavior, the methodology proposed in this work aimed to offer a useful tool for designing thermoplastic-based formulations that are able to ensure an appropriate rheological performance in obtaining 3D-printed parts with the desired geometry and final properties.},

The ease of use, prototyping accuracy and low cost makes it a widely used additive manufacturing technique. FDM creates 3D structures through the layer-by-layer melt-extrusion of a plastic filament. The production of a printed structure involves the generation of a digital design of the model by 3D design software and its execution by the printer until the complete model is reproduced. This review presents the current status of FDM, how to handle and operate FDM printers, industry standards of printing, the types of filaments that can be used, the post-processing treatments, advantages, and limitations as well as an overview of the increasing application fields of FDM technology. The application areas of FDM are endless, including biomedicine, construction, automotive, aerospace, acoustics, textiles, and occupational therapy amongst others. Even during the current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, FDM has helped to fabricate face masks, ventilators and respiratory systems, respiratory valves, and nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 diagnosis. FDM 3D and 4D printing can produce polymeric and composite structures of various designs, and compositions in a range of materials according to the desired application.

These issues can further lead to the deformation of printed parts and even terminate the printing process. In response to these issues, this article established a numerical model of temperature field and thermal stress field for FDM by finite element modeling and ``birth--death element'' technique to predict the deformation of the part. What makes sense in this process is that the logic of elements sort based on ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) was proposed to sort the meshed elements, which was aimed to perform FDM simulation quickly on the model. In this work, the effects of the sheets shape and infill line directions (ILDs) on the distortion during FDM were simulated and verified. From the analysis of stress field and deformation nephogram, the simulation results indicated that ILD had greater effects on the distortion. Moreover, the sheet warping became most serious when the ILD was aligned with the diagonal of the sheet. The simulation results matched well with the experimental results. Thus, the proposed method in this work can be used to optimize the printing parameters for FDM process.},

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most commonly used additive manufacturing processes for plastics and it is fast, cheap, and enables the creation of complex geometries from three dimensional (3D) model data. However, printing parts with overhanging features brings problem such as sagging, distortion and surface roughness quality in part production. In order to prevent these problems, the printers need to connect overhangs with the lower parts of the object or the ground in order to print them. The support structure under overhangs waste material and prolong production time. In this study, tree-like support structures for FDM parts as a case study were generated to maintain dimensional stability of the part and to reduce support material in volume. In this regard, distance between branches, diameter of branches and branch angle were considered as key factors in designing tree-like supports.},

When \texttheta{} {$>$} 50{$^\circ$}, large waviness of the overhang contour, adhesion of powder clusters, severe warp deformation and dross formation increase Ra sharply.},

AM is perceived as an environmentally friendly and sustainable technology and has already gained a lot of attention globally. The potential freedom of design offered by AM is, however, often limited when printing complex geometries due to an inability to support the stresses inherent within the manufacturing process. Additional support structures are often needed, which leads to material, time and energy waste. Research in support structures is, therefore, of great importance for the future and further improvement of additive manufacturing. This paper aims to review the varied research that has been performed in the area of support structures. Fifty-seven publications regarding support structure optimization are selected and categorized into six groups for discussion. A framework is established in which future research into support structures can be pursued and standardized. By providing a comprehensive review and discussion on support structures, AM can be further improved and developed in terms of support waste in the future, thus, making AM a more sustainable technology.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a process using layer by layer additive technique to fabricate the entire 3D models into a functional component. One of the most popular AM technology is fused deposition modeling (FDM) that utilizes thermoplastic filaments as the materials. AM has the ability to produce complex structure easily without additional tool and fixture, therefore, it can save the overall manufacturing process. However, without optimum design and parameter settings, FDM has a limitation in printing overhang structures. Therefore, this study aims to analyze three types of pass-fail overhang features which are draft angle, overhang length and overhang angle varied accordingly to their respective length and angle. These pass-fail features were fabricated using the FDM 3D printer with standardized 3D printing parameters. The dimensional accuracy of these features was evaluated using an image analyzer. The results showed that the allowable overhang length to be produced is starting from the length of 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm. Meanwhile, for the draft and overhang angles, the allowable angle to be produced is \^a‰¥ 50.00 mm and \^a‰¤ 45.00 mm, respectively. From this study, it highlights the limitations of the overhang pass-fail features and provide the designer with the design information to help them designing the optimal design solution using FDM.},

RP systems generally build up a prototype directly from the computer-aided design (CAD) data by using an additive ``layer by layer'' method. The RP technologies have brought several advantages to the manufacturing industry in such a way that these technologies are evolving toward the production of end-use parts. This paper presents a review of rapid prototyping and manufacturing (RP\&M) technologies from their origins. The review includes commercially available RP systems and RP technologies that are still at the development stage or that have been proposed. The operating principles and the features of these technologies are presented. Process parameters such as accuracy, layer thickness, operation speed are given. An extended classification of RP\&M technologies is also included in this paper.},

The model presents the limiting case scenario where the maximum melting rate is controlled by the applied force. Here, instead of having a nozzle filled with polymer melt, the melt is reduced to a melt film at the tip of the filament as it is pushed against the exit of the nozzle. The model uses a mode of melting that is governed by melting with pressure flow melt removal. The model includes effects of initial filament temperatures, heater temperature, applied force, nozzle tip angle, capillary diameter and length as well as rheological and thermal properties. The analytical solution is compared to controlled experiments done on a specially designed set-up. Furthermore, the model is used to assess the effect of nozzle tip angle, heater temperature and initial filament temperature on the melting rate within the nozzle. The comparison between the experiments and the model show that assumptions used for the model development are plausible, and that the model can be used to optimize the melting within a material extrusion additive manufacturing process, as well as predicting the performance of new materials.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has rapidly evolved due to its design flexibility, ability to enable personalized fabrication, and reduced material waste. In the medical field, fused filament fabrication (FFF) facilitates the production of individualized anatomical models for surgical preparation, education, medical imaging, and calibration. However, the lack of filaments with X-ray attenuation similar to that of biological hard tissues limits their use in radiological imaging. To address this limitation, a radiopaque filament was developed by incorporating gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) into a biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) matrix at 1, 3, and 5 wt.\%. Thermal and rheological properties were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and melt flow index (MFI) analyses, revealing minor variations that did not affect printability under standard FFF conditions (200 {$^\circ$}C nozzle, 60 {$^\circ$}C build plate, 0.12 mm layer height). Microstructural analysis via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), elemental mapping, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) confirmed homogeneous Gd2O3 dispersion without nozzle blockage. Radiopacity was evaluated using gyroid infill cubes, and increasing Gd2O3 content enhanced X-ray attenuation, with 3 wt.\% Gd2O3 reaching Hounsfield Unit (HU) values comparable to cortical bone. Finally, the L1 vertebra phantom fabricated from the 3 wt.\% Gd2O3 filament exhibited mean HU values of approximately +200 to +250 HU at 50\% infill density (trabecular bone region) and around +1000 HU at 100\% infill density (cortical bone region), demonstrating the filament's potential for producing cost-effective, radiopaque, and biodegradable phantoms for computed tomography (CT) imaging.},

Over the years, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) has emerged as the biomaterial of choice to reconstruct craniofacial defects. With advancements in additive manufacturing (AM) systems, prospects for the point-of-care (POC) 3D printing of PEEK patient-specific implants (PSIs) have emerged. Consequently, investigating the clinical reliability of POC-manufactured PEEK implants has become a necessary endeavor. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a quantitative assessment of POC-manufactured, 3D-printed PEEK PSIs for cranial reconstruction through characterization of the geometrical, morphological, and biomechanical aspects of the in-hospital 3D-printed PEEK cranial implants. The study results revealed that the printed customized cranial implants had high dimensional accuracy and repeatability, displaying clinically acceptable morphologic similarity concerning fit and contours continuity. From a biomechanical standpoint, it was noticed that the tested implants had variable peak load values with discrete fracture patterns and failed at a mean (SD) peak load of 798.38 \textpm{} 211.45 N. In conclusion, the results of this preclinical study are in line with cranial implant expectations; however, specific attributes have scope for further improvements.},

  abstract = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modeling, is the leading technology for polymer-based additive manufacturing. The simplicity, along with the cleanness, the affordability, and the multi-material capability, are some of the main advantages that have prompted this success. Nonetheless, the uptake of FFF in industry is hampered by the limited functionality of commercial filaments, that are often based on plain thermoplastics. The future growth of FFF into new markets needs a significant improvement of available materials. However, materials requirements in FFF are complicated and often mutually conflicting. Whereas heuristic approaches to materials design imply significant costs in terms of time, energy, and materials, a critical survey of the main requirements that a new material should fulfill in order to be printable and suitable for commercial adoption is still missing. In order to bridge this gap, the present paper analyzes the workflow from filament production to end-of-life disposal of printed objects, and, for each step, brings to light the governing materials properties. Wherever possible, practical guidelines are given on acceptable values. Existing lacks of knowledge are identified to direct future studies. The ultimate goal is to provide a road map to making materials development in FFF more efficient.},

  abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is currently used in several fields, such as architecture, manufacturing, and medical applications. FDM was initially developed to produce and create prototypes, but the expense appears excessive for producing final products. Nevertheless, in this day and age, engineers have developed a low-cost 3D printer. One of the major issues with low-cost 3D printers is the low dimensional accuracy and high tolerances of the printed products. Herein, different printing parameters, i.e., layer thickness, printing speed, and raster angle, need to be investigated to enhance the surface roughness of the parts produced using FDM. Thus, the present study focuses on investigating the performance of the surface finish produced by FDM by manipulating different parameters such as layer thickness, printing speed, and raster angle. Taguchi's method, based on the L9 array for experimental design, was employed to elucidate the response variables. The sample model was developed following ISO standards, utilizing polylactic acid (PLA)--aluminum as the filament material. The analysis of variance results indicated that the layer thickness and raster angle significantly affect the surface roughness of the printed parts, with statistical P-values of 0.016 and 0.039, respectively. This enables an easy selection of the optimal printing parameters to achieve the desired surface roughness. The dimensional accuracy of the fabricated part was also evaluated. Thirteen dimensions of the part features were analyzed, and the results showed that the FDM machine exhibited good accuracy for most of the shapes, with a deviation below 5\%.},

Potential harmful emissions and associated health risks when operating indoors have induced many emission studies. However, the lack of standardization of measurements impeded an objectifiable comparison of research findings. Therefore, we designed a chamber-based standard method, i.e., the strand printing method (SPM), which provides a standardized printing procedure and quantifies systematically the particle emission released from individual FFF-3D filaments under controlled conditions. Forty-four marketable filament products were tested. The total number of emitted particles (TP) varied by approximately four orders of magnitude (109 {$\leq$} TP {$\leq$} 1013), indicating that origin of polymers, manufacturer-specific additives, and undeclared impurities have a strong influence. Our results suggest that TP characterizes an individual filament product and particle emissions cannot be categorized by the polymer type (e.g., PLA or ABS) alone. The user's choice of a filament product is therefore decisive for the exposure to released particles during operation. Thus, choosing a filament product awarded for low emissions seems to be an easily achievable preemptive measure to prevent health hazards.},

The printers need to connect overhangs with the lower parts of the object or the ground in order to print them. Since the support material needs to be printed first and discarded later, optimizing its volume can lead to material and printing time savings. We present a novel, geometry-based approach that minimizes the support material while providing sufficient support. Using our approach, the input 3D model is first oriented into a position with minimal area that requires support. Then the points in this area that require support are detected. For these points the supporting structure is progressively built while attempting to minimize the overall length of the support structure. The resulting structure has a tree-like shape that effectively supports the overhangs. We have tested our algorithm on the MakerBot R \copyright ReplicatorTM 2 printer and we compared our solution to the embedded software solution in this printer and to Autodesk R \copyright MeshmixerTMsoftware. Our solution reduced printing time by an average of 29.4\% (ranging from 13.9\% to 49.5\%) and the amount of material by 40.5\% (ranging from 24.5\% to 68.1\%).},

Improper geometric design of the support structures may result in a sharp deterioration in the surface quality and a failure of manufacture, which affects the expansion in the use of selective laser melting (SLM) technology. In this research, cuboids were added into the conventional block support for a better heat dissipation. The Taguchi method was used to analyze the effect of the geometric design of this support on the part's deformation and surface roughness. It was found that solid pieces or cuboids as support structures can reduce the deformation. However, their effects are weaker than those of teeth structures which decrease the deformation by more reliable connections. It is interesting that narrowing the gap between the cuboids and overhang can weaken the strength of teeth structures and then increases the deformation of part. In general, the distance between every two adjacent walls of support and the gap between the cuboids and the overhang have the greatest influence on the part's deformation and surface quality respectively.},
